---

- Place the values from figure one, into an array based implementation of a Binary Tree.

---

- Perform the following traversals on the binary tree in figure 1:
    - PreOrder traversal
    - InOrder traversal
    - PostOrder traversal
    - LevelOrder traversal.

---

- Using the tree in figure 1, in what order would the values be output if:
    - Using a PostOrder traversal, you push all values onto a stack, then pop them off 1 at a time and output the value.
    - Using a PreOrder traversal, you enqueue all of the values, then dequeue them 1 at a time and output the value.

---

- Again, using the tree in figure 1, re-arrange the values so that is represents a complete BST and draw the resulting tree.

---

- Write a recursive functions to perform:
    - PreOrder traversal
    - InOrder traversal
    - PostOrder traversal

---

- Write a recursive function to calculate the height of a BST node.

---

- Given a sequence of numbers: **11, 6, 8, 19, 4, 10, 5, 17, 43, 49, 31**
    - Insert them into a Binary Search Tree
    - Insert them into a Max Heap
    - Insert them into a Min Heap
    - Insert them into an Avl Tree
